    "## Information Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "All information criteria derive from the **Deviance**, which we learnt about when we learned about the KL-divergence. The idea behind this is covered in our notes on risk and utility, but here is a short summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $p$ is nature's distribution, we want to know how far we are from \"perfect accuracy\" by using $q$. In other words we need to develop a distance scale for distances between distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This scale is called the Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence, introduced in 1951. It is defined thus:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\renewcommand{\\kld}{D_{KL}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\kld(p, q) = E_p[log(p) - log(q)] = E_p[log(p/q)] = \\sum_i p_i log(\\frac{p_i}{q_i}) \\,\\,or\\, \\int dP log(\\frac{p}{q})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The distance between a distribution and itself is clearly $\\kld(p,p) = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use Jensen's inequality for expectations on a convex function $f(x)$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ E[f(X)] \\ge f(E[X]) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "to show that $\\kld(p,q) \\ge 0$ with equality iff (if and only if) $q=p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If one uses the **law or large numbers** to replace the true distribution by its empirical estimate, then we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\kld(p, q) = E_p[log(p/q)] = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_i (log(p_i) - log(q_i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus minimizing the KL-divergence involves maximizing $\\sum_i log(q_i)$ which is exactly the log likelihood. Hence we can justify the maximum likelihood principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparing models\n",
    "\n",
    "By the same token we can use the KL-Divergences of two different models to do model comparison:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\kld(p, q) -\\kld(p, r) = E_p[log(r) - log(q)] = E_p[log(\\frac{r}{q})]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that except for choosing the empirical samples, $p$ has dissapeared from this formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "f you look at the expression above, you notice that to compare a model with distribution $r$ to one with distribution $q$, you only need the sample averages of the logarithm of $r$ and $q$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\kld(p, q) -\\kld(p, r) = \\langle log(r) \\rangle - \\langle log(q) \\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the angled brackets mean sample average. If we define the deviance:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$D(q) = -2 \\sum_i log(q_i)$$,\n",
    "\n",
    "then\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\kld(p, q) -\\kld(p, r) = \\frac{2}{N} (D(q) - D(r))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "so that we can use the deviance's for model comparison instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, we can define the deviance without using the sample average over the empirical distribution as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ D(q) = - \\frac{N}{2} E_p[log(q)] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now in the frequentist realm one uses likelihoods. In the bayesian realm, the **posterior predictive**, which has learned from the data seems to be the more sensible distribution to use. But lets work our way there.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we are trying to estimate \n",
    "\n",
    "$$E_p[log(pred(y^*))]$$\n",

    "\n",
    "What predictive distribution $pred$ do we use? We start from the frequentist scenario of using the likelihood at the MLE, then move to using the likelihood at the posterior mean (a sort of plug in approximation) for the DIC, and finally to the fully Bayesian WAIC.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, in the first two cases, we are writing the predictive distribution conditioned on a point estimate from the posterior:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$elpd_i = E_p[log(pred(y_i^* \\mid \\hat{\\theta}))]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The game we will play in these first two cases is:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Conditional on fixed $\\theta$, the full predictive splits into a product per point so the writing of elppd as a sum over pointwise elpd is exact\n",
    "(2) However we dont know $p$, so we use the empirical distribution on the training set\n",
    "(3) this underestimates the test set deviance as we learnt in the case of the AIC, so we must apply a correction factor."

It might look like the posterior predictive to you, but remember, we are *not drawing* new y here, but rather computing expectations over existing y.

    "## Using information criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "I will just quote McElreath:\n",
    "\n",
    ">But once we have DIC or WAIC calculated for each plausible model, how do we use these values? Since information criteria values provide advice about relative model performance, they can be used in many different ways. Frequently, people discuss MODEL SELECTION, which usually means choosing the model with the lowest AIC/DIC/WAIC value and then discarding the others. But this kind of selection procedure discards the information about relative model accuracy contained in the differences among the AIC/DIC/WAIC values. Why is this information useful? Because sometimes the differences are large and sometimes they are small. Just as relative posterior probability provides advice about how confident we might be about parameters (conditional on the model), relative model accuracy provides advice about how confident we might be about models (conditional on the set of models compared).\n",
    "\n",
    ">So instead of model selection, this section provides a brief example of model comparison and model averaging.\n",
    "- MODEL COMPARISON means using DIC/WAIC in combination with the estimates and posterior predictive checks from each model. It is just as important to understand why a model outperforms another as it is to measure the performance difference. DIC/WAIC alone says very little about such details. But in combination with other information, DIC/WAIC is a big help.\n",
    "- MODEL AVERAGING means using DIC/WAIC to construct a posterior predictive distribution that exploits what we know about relative accuracy of the models. This helps guard against overconfidence in model structure, in the same way that using the entire posterior distribution helps guard against overconfidence in parameter values. What model averaging does not mean is averaging parameter estimates, because parameters in different models have different meanings and should not be averaged, unless you are sure you are in a special case in which it is safe to do so. So it is better to think of model averaging as prediction averaging, because that's what is actually being done. (McElreath 195-196)\n",

    "**It is critical that you use information criteria to only compare models with the same likelihood**. \n",

    "Let me quote McElreath again:\n",
    "\n",
    ">it is tempting to use information criteria to compare models with different likelihood functions. Is a Gaussian or binomial better? Can't we just let WAIC sort it out?\n",
    "\n",
    ">Unfortunately, WAIC (or any other information criterion) cannot sort it out. The problem is that deviance is part normalizing constant. The constant affects the absolute magnitude of the deviance, but it doesn't affect fit to data. Since information criteria are all based on deviance, their magnitude also depends upon these constants. That is fine, as long as all of the models you compare use the same outcome distribution type—Gaussian, binomial, exponential, gamma, Poisson, or another. In that case, the constants subtract out when you compare models by their differences. But if two models have different outcome distributions, the constants don't subtract out, and you can be misled by a difference in AIC/DIC/WAIC. (McElreath 288)\n"
