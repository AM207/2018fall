These are values from a t-test that asks if the coefficient is different from 0. The regression machinery assumes Normality of errors for this purpose. Lets assume the Normality and do an inference on all the years in our regression. The assumption used to calculate these p-values are: for each model (in our case `year`), the errors at each point of the regression are uncorrelated and follow a Normal distribution. We shall assume these to be true for now (in real life you ought to be checking a plot of residuals as well).\n",

        "\nFurthermore, when constructing results like this (where there are many tests considered at once) there are other concerns to take into account. One such concern is the issue of [multiple testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_comparisons_problem). This is important because when we start dealing with a **large number** of hypotheses jointly the probability of making mistakes gets larger, hence we should be **more stringent** about what it means for a result to be significant. One such correction is the [**Bonferroni Correction**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonferroni_correction) which provides a new bound for deciding significance. Instead of asking the classic question: **is the p-value < $0.05$**?, this considers instead a stricter bound, we ask: **is p-value < $0.05/H$**. Where $H$ is the number of hypotheses being considered, in our case $H = 38$ (the number of years) -- this is a much higher bar for significance."
