        "As the U.S. aims to increase early identification and treatment of people with HIV, a greater focus has been placed on determining the accuracy of HIV tests in real-world settings in order to better identify individuals during the early (acute) stages of infection when transmission risk is especially high.  In order to quantify this, researchers from the University of California, San Francisco conducted a review of over 21,234 HIV tests given between the years 2003 and 2008 in some of the city's highest prevalence populations.  Two of the tests included in the study -- the OraQuick Advance Blood Rapid Antibody Test (a 3rd generation fingerstick blood test we'll henceforth call the **BRT**) and the OraQuick Advance Saliva Rapid Antibody Test (a 3rd generation saliva test we'll henceforth call the **SRT**) -- can be considered Rapidly Administered tests.  According to Wikipedia, the overall prevalence of adult HIV in the United States is 0.3%\n",

Let us begin to explore how to handle missing data in our analysis.  We'll be working with a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository that uses a variety of wine chemical predictors to classify wines grown in the same region in Italy.  Each line represents 13 (mostly chemical) predictors of the response variable wine class, including things like alcohol content, hue, and phenols.  Unfortunately some of the predictor values were lost in measurement.  You'll find the dataset in a file called `wine_quality_missing.csv`.\n",
